# DEVICE_FUSION
A console application that merges mods for GameMaker games that are distributed as .xdelta files.

## Usage
First, choose Gaster or non-Gaster mode.
Next, enter the path of your data.win file and, on a different line, the path where the combined mods data.win should be saved (For v1.0.0 you should not write the filename, for later versions you should.)
Then, enter the number of mods you would like to merge and the paths to the .xdelta files.
After that, the application should begin merging mods. Now you just neet to wait for merging to finish.
